# VBL PC website

This is a simple website project to showcase the services of the company VBL PC.
The goal of the project was to revamp the current website to have a clean and accessible page on the web to represent the company and get more visibility on search engines.
VBL PC is a local computer repair business, so I made sure to respect three points :
- Make the navigation as simple as possible (one page, no complex features)
- Display the contact info as clearly as possible
- Embed a section to display the localization of the company on a map
